I have a couple of complaints but overall I'm very happy with this project. It does exactly what I wanted it to do.
But here are my compliaints: 
1. The graphing is kind of cluttered. Moving it to an interactive version will overall beneifit me on the whole
2. It would be nice to have a GUI but again the terminal application does enough for now.
